# ESP8266DaikinAC
Control Daikin AC unit via IR using ESP8266

Uses https://github.com/markszabo/IRremoteESP8266 

Basically a rough and ready copy/pasta of example codes, currently undergoing cleanup. Looking to integrate timer functionality.

Presents the appropriate API for https://github.com/rudders/homebridge-http to switch Daikin AC unit to Heat/Cool/Auto/Off modes via HomeKit using the Homebridge project at https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge
